Using Hping commands on Kali Linux, we are pinging a Window 7 host with different customized packets in this lab.

•	To create an ACK packet: root@kali:~# hping3 –A 192.168.0.1
•	To create SYN scan against different ports: root@kali:~# hping3 -8 1-600 –S 10.10.50.202
•	To create a packet with FIN, URG, and PSH flags sets root@kali:~# hping3 –F –P -U 10.10.50.202
